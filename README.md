# CSE255: Region Wealth Level Detection through Booster-Based Image Processing
A final project for CSE255 using a booster, completed under the instruction of Professor Yoav Freund, the inventor of the AdaBoost algorithm.

The objective was to predict the wealth level of regions using a large dataset of 8-channel satellite images. A booster-based model employing KD-trees as the primary identification unit was implemented. The model was refined through feature engineering, optimizing pixel selection to extract various image patterns effectively.
