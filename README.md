cse255:  region wealth level detection through booster based image processing

A final project of cse255 using booster completed under instruction of yoav freund, the inventor of AdaBoost algorithm.

The target is to predict the wealth level of regions from a large dataset of 8-channel satellite pictures. A booster based model with KD-trees as basic identifier unit is implemented. The model is adjusted with feature engineering on the input to select the most effective combination of pixels and extract various image patterns.
